# Using RustHDL

This section of the documentation covers the details of using RustHDL to generate firmware.  

Here is an overview of the sections.

- [bits](bits.md) - how to manage arbitrary bit-width signals
- [operators](operators.md) - operations that are defined on signals
- [signals](signals.md) - the struct used to represent a signal (wire) in the firmware
- [traits](traits.md) - the traits used to implement RustHDL
- [synthesizable](synthesizable.md) - the synthesizable subset of Rust
- [interfaces](interfaces.md) - how to simplify your designs with interfaces
- [simulation](simulation.md) - how to simulate your design in RustHDL
- [high level synthesis](high_level_synthesis.md) - a high level synthesis library written in RustHDL
- [loops](loops.md) - loops and arrays in RustHDL
- [structs](struct_valued.md) - using struct-valued signals in RustHDL
- [verilog](verilog.md) - generating Verilog from your RustHDL code
- [wrapping](wrapping.md) - wrapping black box cores and other Verilog with your RustHDL code
