# Using RustHDL

This section of the documentation covers the details of using RustHDL to generate firmware.  

Here is an overview of the sections.

- [bits](bits.md) - how to manage arbitrary bit-width signals
- [operators](operators.md) - operations that are defined on signals
- [signals](signals.md) - the struct used to represent a signal (wire) in the firmware
- [traits](traits.md) - the traits used to implement RustHDL
- [synthesizable](synthesizable.md) - the synthesizable subset of Rust
