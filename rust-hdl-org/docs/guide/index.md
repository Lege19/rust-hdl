# The Basics

Let's start with the basic questions you may be asking yourself:

- What is RustHDL?  
- Why do we need it?  
- What is an FPGA anyway!  
- Where are my shoes?

These are all valid, and important questions, and I hope to answer at least a couple
of them in the course of this guide (did you check outside the front door?).   If none of
these are interesting to you, move on.  This guide is probably not meant for you.

Still here? Great! This is meant to be helpful.

The guide is broken down into sections.

- [What is an FPGA](./fpga/index.md) has some musings on FPGAs and maybe some useful tools to 
explain them to your colleagues.
- [Programming](./programming/index.md) has a few observations on different programming models for
FPGAs and how RustHDL fits in
- [Using RustHDL](./rusthdl/index.md) covers the details of using RustHDL to build firmware
