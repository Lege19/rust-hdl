# Programming models for FPGAs

I'm no expert on the history of FPGA programming.  However, I can point out some guideposts in the area of FPGA programming, and my experience with them to date. Your mileage may, of course, vary.

- [Verilog](./verilog.md) - adapted from simulating circuits to describing them
- [Lucid](./lucid.md) - an improvement on the ergonomics and DX for Verilog
- [MyHDL/MiGen/Python](./migen.md) - Python based approaches to describing firmware
