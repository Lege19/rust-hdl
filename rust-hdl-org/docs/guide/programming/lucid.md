# Lucid

Lucid is an excellent example of how Verilog can be improved.  Developed by 
what is now Alchitry Labs, Lucid is a higher level language that can be translated
into Verilog by the Alchitry IDE.  Lucid introduces things like types, structs, 
and other concepts that we will encounter.  These are standard
programming concepts that we think about all the time, but which are typically
absent in standard Verilog code.  At least as of now (Nov 2021), Lucid is tied to the
Alchitry IDE, and while I enjoy using Alchitry products, I also need to use FPGAs from
other vendors and suppliers.
