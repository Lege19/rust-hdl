Write FPGA Firmware using Rust

`rust-hdl` is a crate that allows you to write FPGA firmware using Rust!
Specifically, `rust-hdl` compiles a subset of Rust down to Verilog so that
you can synthesize firmware for your FPGA using standard tools.  It also
provides tools for simulation, verification, and analysis along with strongly
typed interfaces for making sure your design works before heading to the bench.
